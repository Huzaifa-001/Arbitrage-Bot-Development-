Arbitrage Bot Development 
📖 Overview 
Arbitrage Bot Development is a Python-based automation system designed to identify and execute cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges. 
The bot continuously monitors price differences for specific assets and performs profitable buy-sell trades in real time.
This project aims to automate crypto trading, reduce manual intervention, and maximize profit margins using real-time data analysis and efficient transaction handling.

⚡ Features: 
🔍 Real-time price tracking from multiple exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, etc.)
📊 Spread calculation and automatic arbitrage opportunity detection
🤖 Auto-trading execution with configurable profit margins
⚙️ Customizable trading pairs and parameters
💾 Trade logging and performance reporting
🔐 Secure API key management
🧠 Scalable modular architecture (easy to extend to new exchanges)

🧰 Tech Stack: 
Category	Technology
Language	Python 3.x
Libraries	ccxt, pandas, requests, asyncio
Database	SQLite / PostgreSQL (optional)

Version Control	Git + GitHub

🚀 Getting Started: 
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Huzaifa-001/Arbitrage-Bot-Development-.git
cd Arbitrage-Bot-Development-

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root folder:
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_secret_key
COINBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
COINBASE_API_SECRET=your_secret_key
PROFIT_THRESHOLD=0.5

4️⃣ Run the Bot
python main.py

📈 Example Output: 
[INFO] Checking price differences...
[FOUND] Arbitrage opportunity detected: BTC/USDT
Buy on Binance: $26,120 | Sell on Coinbase: $26,320 | Profit: +0.76%
[EXECUTED] Trade executed successfully.

🧠 How It Works: 
The bot connects to multiple crypto exchanges using the CCXT library.
It fetches current market prices of selected trading pairs.
It calculates the spread between exchanges.
If the spread exceeds your configured profit threshold, the bot:
Buys from the cheaper exchange.
Sells at the higher-priced one.
Logs and reports the trade outcome.

🧪 Future Enhancements: 
✅ Add support for futures and perpetual contracts
✅ Integrate Telegram/Discord alerts
✅ Implement AI-based profit prediction
✅ Add dashboard for monitoring trades in real time
